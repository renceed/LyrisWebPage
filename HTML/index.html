Lock me up and throw away the key
He knows how to get the best out of me
I'm no force for the world to see
Trade my whole life just to be</p>

<p style ="color:orange" style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
Tell nobody I control you
I broke you just to own you
They can't tell but I love you
'Cause you're loyal, baby
I love when you're submissive
You love it when I break skin
You feel pain without flinchin'
So say it</p>
 
<p style ="color:pink" style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
Give me tough love
Leave me with nothin' when I come down
My kind of love
Force me and choke me 'til I pass out</p>
 
<p style ="color:orange" style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
We don't gotta bе in love, no
I don't gotta be the onе, no
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight, oh</p>

<p style ="color:orange" style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
Push me down, hold me down
Spit in my mouth while you turn me out
I wanna take your light inside
Tear me down, snuff me out
Hands on my neck while you push it up
And I'm screamin' now</p>

<p style ="color:pink" style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
Give me tough love
Leave me with nothin' when I come down
My kind of love
Force me and choke me 'til I pass out</p>

<p style="color:orange" style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight (Tonight)
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no (Oh)
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight, oh</p>

<p style="color:orange" style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
Lock me up and throw away the key
He knows how to get the best out of me
I'm no force for the world to see
Trade my whole life just to be
Top of the world, but I'm still not free
This is a secret that I keep
Until it's gone, I can never find peace
Waste my whole life just to be</p>

<p style="color:orange" style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight (Tonight)
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no (Oh)
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight (Oh), oh</p>
